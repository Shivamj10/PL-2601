=> Introduction to GitHub 
GitHub is a cloud server
It is used to store the source code of the application
GitHub is GUI based

In GitHub we will create repositories
Repository is nothing but a folder in cloud

In GitHub we can create 2 types of repos;
	Public Repo		- the files available in public repo can be accessed by anyone on the browser
	Private Repo		- the files available in private repo can only be accessed by the repo owner and also access can be given to individuals using their GitHub email ids

For every repo we will have repo URL.
Using repo URL we can directly access the data inside that particular repo

Types of repo URLs;
	HTTPS
	SSH

=> Pushing the code from local to remote
		git push

=> Cloning a repo
To get the code available from remote repo to local
		git clone <Repo.URL>

Note: When we clone a repo, no need to initialize git again.
Note: In git bash terminal the default branch is master
Note: In GitHub, the default branch is main

==> Git Branches
amazon ----> movies, documentaries, sports, sci-fi
movies --- dev1 --- responsible to develop movies feature --- write the code
documentaries --- dev2 --- responsible to develop documentaries feature --- write the code
sports --- dev3 --- responsible to develop sprots feature --- write the code
sci-fi --- dev4 --- responsible to develop sci-fi feature --- write the code

Repo Name: amazon-app

All the developers will push the code to the same repo
Developers will create Branches - for each of the app, developers will create a branch and then each feature code will be pushed to that particular branch

Branches are used to isolate the source code the features available in an application

Note: the default branch is master/main

git branch ---> to see the list of branches available in local
git branch -r ---> to see the list of branches available in remote
git branch -a ---> to see all the remote and local branches

git branch movies-dev1

GIT PULL
git pull is used to pull the changes from remote to local
